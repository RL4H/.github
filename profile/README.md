# Reinforcement Learning for Heath 

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a Machine Learning (ML) paradigm, used for decision-making tasks, where an agent learns to achieve a specified goal, by interacting with its underlying environment. Compared to the widely explored games (Chess, Go) and physics simulation problems (MuJuCo) in RL, real-world RL systems must contend with much more technical challenges. We explore the use of RL in healthcare applications.

1. **Glucose regulation in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)**, is a challenging task, which results in a sequential decision-making problem, where the aim is to solve a continuous control problem of determining the amount of insulin delivery to the body to maintain an optimal glucose level.
